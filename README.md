# Very-Basic-Calculator-Webapp
This is a homework from Dr. Okan ÖKTÜRKMENOĞLU for BIL209: Intro to Web Based Programming.
The goal of this assignment is to make a basic calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Some of Dr. Okan's suggestions/advices:

1) Program should take two (2) inputs, perform four basic operations (summ, subtract, multiply, divide) and show the result on the screen.
2) Should be styled using CSS (inline, external, internal).
3) The operation the perform can be selected by a dropdown menu or with seperate buttons.
4) JavaScript functions can be external.
5) Can use JQuery instead of JavaScript.
